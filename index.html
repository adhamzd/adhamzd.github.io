  <h1> Civil Engineering </h1>
    <img src="images/I1.jpg" alt="Civil Engineering Image">
    <p> <strong>Civil Engineering </strong>is a professional engineering discipline 
that deals with the design, construction, and maintenance of the 
physical and naturally built environment, including public works 
such as roads, bridges, canals, dams, airports, sewage systems,
 pipelines, structural components of buildings, and railways.</p>

<p> Civil engineering is traditionally broken into a number of 
sub-disciplines. It is considered the second-oldest engineering
 discipline after military engineering, and it is defined to 
distinguish non-military engineering from military engineering. 
Civil engineering can take place in the public sector from municipal 
public works departments through to federal government agencies, and 
in the private sector from locally based firms to global Fortune 500 companies. </p>
