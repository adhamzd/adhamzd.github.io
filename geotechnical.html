<h1> Geotechnical Engineering </h1>
<img src="images/geo.jpg" alt="Geotechnical Engineering Image">
<p><strong> Geotechnical Engineering </strong> also known as geotechnics, is the branch of civil engineering concerned 
with the engineering behavior of earth materials. It uses the principles 
of soil mechanics and rock mechanics for the solution of its respective 
engineering problems. It also relies on knowledge of geology, hydrology, 
geophysics, and other related sciences. Geotechnical (rock) engineering 
is a subdiscipline of geological engineering. In addition to civil engineering, 
geotechnical engineering also has applications in military, mining, petroleum, 
coastal engineering, and offshore construction. The fields of geotechnical 
engineering and engineering geology have knowledge areas that overlap, 
however, while geotechnical engineering is a specialty of civil engineering, 
engineering geology is a specialty of geology: They share the same principles 
of soil mechanics and rock mechanics, but differ in the application.</p>
