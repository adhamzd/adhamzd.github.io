  <h1> Transportation Engineering </h1>

<p><strong>Transportation Engineering </strong>is the application of technology and 
scientific principles to the planning, functional design, operation and management of 
facilities for any mode of transportation in order to provide for the safe, efficient, 
rapid, comfortable, convenient, economical, and environmentally compatible movement of people and goods transport.
The planning aspects of transportation engineering relate to elements of urban planning, and involve technical 
forecasting decisions and political factors. Technical forecasting of passenger travel usually involves an urban 
transportation planning model, requiring the estimation of trip generation (number of purposeful trips), trip distribution 
(destination choice, where the traveler is going), mode choice (mode that is being taken), and route assignment 
(the streets or routes that are being used). More sophisticated forecasting can include other aspects of traveler decisions,
 including auto ownership, trip chaining (the decision to link individual trips together in a tour) and the choice of residential 
or business location (known as land use forecasting). Passenger trips are the focus of transportation engineering because they often 
represent the peak of demand on any transportation system. A review of descriptions of the scope of various committees indicates that 
while facility planning and design continue to be the core of the transportation engineering field, such areas as operations planning, 
logistics, network analysis, financing, and policy analysis are also important, particularly to those working in highway and urban transportation.
