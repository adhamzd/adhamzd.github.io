<p><strong>Environmental Engineering </strong>is a professional engineering discipline that encompasses broad scientific topics like 
chemistry, biology, ecology, geology, hydraulics, hydrology, microbiology, and mathematics to create solutions that will protect and
 also improve the health of living organisms and improve the quality of the environment. Environmental engineering is a sub-discipline 
of civil engineering and chemical engineering. Environmental engineering is the application of scientific and engineering principles to improve 
and maintain the environment to:123

<li>and improve environmental-related enhancement of the quality of human life.</li></ul></p>
<p>Environmental engineers devise solutions for wastewater management, water and air pollution control, 
recycling, waste disposal, and public health. They design municipal water supply and industrial 
wastewater treatment systems, and design plans to prevent waterborne diseases and improve sanitation in urban,
 rural and recreational areas. They evaluate hazardous-waste management systems to evaluate the severity of such hazards, 
advise on treatment and containment, and develop regulations to prevent mishaps. They implement environmental engineering
 law, as in assessing the environmental impact of proposed construction projects. Environmental engineers study the effect
 of technological advances on the environment, addressing local and worldwide environmental issues such as acid rain, global
 warming, ozone depletion, water pollution and air pollution from automobile exhausts and industrial sources</p>
